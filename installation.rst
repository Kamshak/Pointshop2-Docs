Getting Started
===============

Installation
------------
To install Pointshop2 simply extract the zip you downloaded into the addons folder.

Configuration
-------------
Pointshop2 requires no initial configuration! Once it is installed you are ready to go!
Restart your server and press F3 to open the menu. If nothing happens, use the "pointshop2" console command.
You can find all settings under the "Management" tab.


FastDL
------
Unless players already have the files from other places, they will see errors or texture problems if there is no FastDL system. If you haven't already set this up, see here http://maurits.tv/data/garrysmod/wiki/wiki.garrysmod.com/index70e8.html. Pointshop2 automatically uses resource.AddFiles to add all required files to the server downloads. To avoid errors, please  upload the following files to your fastdl server:

- addons/pointshop2/materials
- addons/libk/resource

Make sure to upload them into your fastdl's root folder, i.e. *addons/pointshop2/materials* to *fastdl/materials*, NOT *fastdl/addons/pointshop2/materials*.
